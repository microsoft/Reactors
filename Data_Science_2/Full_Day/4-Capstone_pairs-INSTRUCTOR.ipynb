    "\n",
    "In this Capstone Project you will be engaging with the stock price data.  This includes daily price data on several hundred stocks over a period of 5 years.  \n",
    "The data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse#prices-split-adjusted.csv) and is available in its original form there under a CC0 license.  We will be using a slightly preprocessed version in the repo.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will be investigating Pairs Trading strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline: \n",
    "1. Getting and describing the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exploring, cleaning and visualizing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Developing analytics\n",
    "- Using Correlation\n",
    "- Using Cointegration (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Risk review: improving accuracy and realism\n",
    "- Time keeps on slipping into the future\n",
    "- Transaction concerns\n",

    "6. Your turn to move forward\n",
    "\n",
    "## Options\n",
    "As we progress you are encouraged to take this dataset further.  You are also encouraged to explore any aspects of the data. Develop your own algorithms.  Be explicit about your inquiry and success in predicting effects on our world.\n",

    "## Warning: Not financial advice\n",

    "## 0. Overview\n",
    "Pairs trading is a type of statistical arbitrage, which is exploiting statistical properties that we believe can make money if they continue.   \n",
    "General Idea:  \n",
    "1) Find two stocks which move similarly.  \n",
    "2) Find where the prices move apart.  \n",
    "3) Sell the high one and buy the low one.  \n",
    "4) Wait for them to come back into line.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Practice obtaining manipulating and thinking about time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Gain awareness of the challenges in working with financial data.\n",

    "## 1. Getting and Describing the data.\n",

    "Now you are going to get a chance to build a pairs trading model that could help you predict when to buy and sell stocks.  To get started, you must load the data."

Numpy is a mathematical toolkit that helps us quickly manipulate numerical data. Pandas is a data scientist's \"swiss army knife\", with a series and a dataframe object that help manipulate and clean data. Matplotlib and Seaborn work together to produce visualizations. Scipy and [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/gettingstarted.html) both contain specialized scientific and statistical functions. In practice as you develop code you may need to iteratively import more and specialized tools. You may not need to follow all these links, but they are here if you find you need a review."

    "You may wonder why we use a new column rather than modifying stocks column 'date'.  This is a matter of personal preference and a trade-off.  Many data scientists and engineers prefer to assign a new column because it makes the Jupyter notebook robust to running a cell twice.  These run twice bugs are a common \"gotcha\" of Jupyter notebooks in practice. The mathematical term for a process or function that gives the same output if you run it 2 or more times in a row is idempotent.  It also makes our code more like data engineering pipeline code, which makes the process of putting your code into data processing pipelines easier.  \n",

    "On the other hand, it makes your data take up more space so if you are very concerned about memory, you might decide to change your column in place.  "

    "\n",
    "[Correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence) is the statistical tendency of two variables to move together.  It measures of the strength of the linear relationship between two numeric variables.  It can range between 1, which indicates that if 1 variable increases, then the other will as well, to -1 which means that if 1 variable increases, then the other decreases.  At 0 then the change on 1 variable gives you no (linear) information about the likely change in the other.  Correlation does not indicate which variable causes a change in the other, leading to the wisdom that *correlation is not causation*.\n",

    "For one thing we have been simplistic about time.  Did you notice?  Where have we made coding assumptions that have lookahead bias.  That is, where have our strategies relied on statistics with information from the future?  To fix this we should be careful about backtesting, which is a process of realistically using historical data, but not using information that would not be available to a decision maker at that point in the past.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have also assumed it is free to trade securities.  In reality backtests will often look profitable until you take transaction costs into account, at which point the sad trombone of losses starts playing.  If transaction costs make a strategy unprofitable, that false opportunity can persist in the market for a long time.  \n",

You might want a function that moves through days and chooses only strong z-scores at that time.  There are several packages such as [Backtrader](www.backtrader.com) or [Zipline](https://www.zipline.io/) among others that can help with these tasks."
