Public, Private and Hybrid/Consortium Blockchain
------------------------------------------------

There are several types of blockchains that manage the way that the
blockchains are accessed and utilized as well as how the blockchains
perform and whether the blockchain will be public, private or a hybrid.

-   **Public blockchains** are broadly available.

    -   Anyone can access transaction history, create new transactions,
        and validate them into new blocks.

    -   No need for trust, everything is recorded on the blockchain.

    -   Higher level of security since the more people using the
        blockchain, the more difficult it is to attack.

    -   Transparency of public blockchain increases potential use cases.

-   **Private/permissioned blockchains** provide infrastructure,
    handling and validating data transactions.

    -   Cost-effective because they don't require mining based consensus
        mechanisms and provide overall management over transactions
        within the chain.

    -   Only allows certain entities to participate.

    -   Participants are granted specific rights and restrictions in the
        network, so someone could have full access or limited access at
        the discretion of the network.

    -   More centralized in nature as only a small group controls the
        network.

    -   Private blockchains have fewer participants and thus are faster
        to achieve consensus.

    -   Private blockchains are more scalable since only a few nodes are
        authorized and responsible for managing data, the network is
        able to process more transactions.

-   **Hybrid/Consortium** blockchains are a combination of private and
    public blockchains.

    -   Used by a group of organizations that work jointly on developing
        different solutions.

    -   Restricted-access blockchain, each organization is able to
        maintain its intellectual property rights within the consortium.

    -   Hybrid between low-trust public blockchains and the
        highly-trusted private blockchains.

    -   The consortium is permissioned for a predetermined group of
        enterprises.

    -   It is semi-decentralized and under the supervision of a limited
        set of members.

    -   Utilizes multi-party consensus in that all operations are
        verified by special pre-approved nodes, not by the world
        community, like in bitcoin blockchain.

Some commonly used blockchains include:

-   [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/):
    A public blockchain which is shared and utilized across a global
    network.

    -   Each new block is added utilizing the proof of work consensus
        model.

-   [Azure Blockchain
    Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/blockchain/):
    A fully managed ledger service that enables users the ability to
    grow and operate blockchain networks at scale in Azure.

-   [Multichain](https://www.multichain.com/): MultiChain helps
    organizations to build and deploy blockchain applications.

-   [Hyperledger Besu](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/besu):
    Designed to be enterprise-friendly for both public and private
    permissioned network use cases.
