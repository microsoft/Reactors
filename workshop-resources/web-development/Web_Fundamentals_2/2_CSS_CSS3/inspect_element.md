# Inspect Element

Editing HTML and CSS can feel like disarming a bomb; one little change and your project goes bananas. Your greatest ally in editing is a browser tool called **Developer Tools**. It is included in nearly all modern browsers available today.

To access the inspect element, right-click any element within the browser window and then click **'Inspect'** and _voila!_ The inspect element displays all properties of the web page you are viewing.

Each browser displays the page code in its own way. Check your browser's documentation, or ask your instructor how. For reference, here is the [guide to the developer tools built into the Edge browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide).
