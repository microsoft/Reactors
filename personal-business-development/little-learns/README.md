# Little Learns *(3 Episode Series)*


Each week I take a look at a different technology on the Microsoft stack, with a fun and friendly theme. Over the weeks we'll explore Power Apps, Azure Functions, and Azure Cognitive Services. 

This series is designed with students, beginners, and all learners in mind! Come along to learn with me, as I shows you how I went about creating my first ever project in these technologies, and how you can do it too!


**Livestreaming Thurdsays in April / 7PM AEST / 2:30PM IST at [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Microsoft-Reactor-Sydney/) and available on-demand on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkm6luGCS3hD25jcEhvRMIA) thereafter.**

# Episode info

## [POSTPONED DUE TO UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES] <br> **Episode 1 - Plant-apdeia** <br>  Build your own canvas app with Power Apps

In this learn-with-me episode, I take a look at how you can create an no-code app for phone or mobile using Power App. I'll use this fast and simple tool to create "Plant-apedia", and app to help her care for my growing plant population!

I'll show you how structured data as simple as an Excel spreadsheet can be used to generate a functioning app in seconds, which you can then customise with your own features and functionality. 

Learn how to publish and share your app, so everyone can start using it on the go. 

This episode is perfect for anyone who wants to give Power Apps a go for the first time, and for any budding Microsoft Student Ambassadors looking for resources to teach their peers about Power Apps.

<br>

## **Episode 2 - Fishy Functions** <br> Serverless computing endpoints with Azure Functions 
In this learn-with-me episode, I take a look at Azure Functions to create serverless computing solutions for taking care of your fishy friends. 

I'll discuss what makes a serverless solutions right for you, and then learn how to create, execute, monitor, and test Azure functions in the Azure portal. I'll build an Azure Function endpoint that kicks into gear whenever it receives requests from our (imaginary) aquariums, to calculate what needs to be done to keep maintain our aquatic environments. 

This episode is perfect for anyone who wants to give Azure Functions and Serverless computing a go for the first time, as well as any budding Microsoft Student Ambassadors looking for resources to teach their peers about Power Apps.

**Student Ambassodors** <br>

## **Episode 3 - The Pen Pal Project** <br> Using Azure Cognitive Services for language translation in web apps

In this learn-with-me episode, I take a look at Azure Cognitive Services' Translator service. I'll combine this with a Python Flask web app to build a website that translates text, perfect for keeping conversation flowing with your pen pals!

In this episode you'll learn how to build a web app with Flask that uses request to call the translation endpoint you set up. We'll use the web app we create to write our letters to our pen pals and display them in the native language of our foreign friends.

This episode is perfect for anyone who wants to give using Azure Cognitive Services or Flask a go for the first time. It's also perfect for any budding Microsoft Student Ambassadors looking for resources to teach their peers about Power Apps.
