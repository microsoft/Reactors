    "We have examined building and fitting machine-learning (ML) models “locally.” To use these models, you would have to load data into your notebooks and get the results there.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we want those models to be accessible from a number of locations. And while the management of production ML models has a lifecycle all its own, one part of that is making models accessible from the web. One way to do so is to develop them by using third-party cloud tools, such as [Microsoft Azure Machine Learning](https://ml.azure.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud-based ML-development tools like Azure Machine Learning streamline the building, training, and deployment of machine-learning models by providing a drag-and-drop interface and making a wide array of ML algorithms and tools readily available. Crucially, such tools simplify the deployment and management of ML models in production (not a focus of this course, but a major consideration in the real world). Let's revisit our simple linear model from the last session using the social indicators dataset, this time in Azure Machine Learning.\n",

    "The outliers have dragged our regression line off of the cluster. One way to address this is to add an additional, weighted term to the [ordinary least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares) equation that we used to calculate our regression line. Tuning this weight parameter for this additional term will help our regression put less emphasis on the outlying points and greater emphasis on the well-clustered points. The specific technique we'll use for this is called [ridge regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization) (also referred to as L2 regularization, which is how you will see it in Azure machine learning).\n",
