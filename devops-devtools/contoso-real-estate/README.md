The event organization guide is a step-by-step guide to help you organize a successful event. It includes tips on how to find speakers, how to promote your event, and more.

You will also find a list of presentations and workshops that you can use to present at your event. These presentations and workshops are based on the **Contoso Real Estate** project. This is a great opportunity to share knowledge about cloud-native applications within your community!

[Contoso Real Estate](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-real-estate) is an open source JavaScript reference project that features a composite architecture with eight key scenarios targeted at companies looking for robust and scalable solutions. The project demonstrates best development practices such as the use of monorepo (to coordinate multiple teams and projects), devcontainers (for Codespaces), integrated documentation (to make code easier to explore), micro-frontends, and much more. In addition, the project has cutting-edge tools for development, from coding in VS Code to testing with Playwright, deploying with Azure Dev CLI, automation with GitHub Actions, and a complete and ready-to-use development environment on Github Codespaces. The project also offers insights into using artificial intelligence with GitHub Copilot.
