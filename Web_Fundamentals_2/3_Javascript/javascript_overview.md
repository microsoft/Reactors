# What is JavaScript and why do you need to know it

## JavaScript is one of the Big 3 Languages of the Web

At the base level, **HTML defines the elements on the page, CSS styles those elements, and JS describes the behavior of those elements.** Beyond that, JS has the power to not only add logic to your page but also to manipulate the HTML and CSS. No matter where you go in Web Development, you will need to know JavaScript. JavaScript describes every interaction on most modern Web pages.

## JavaScript is an Interpreted Language

An interpreted language is a language that is evaluated line-by-line at run-time. This means that there must be an interpreter that can evaluate the code that you write in order for it to work! That's right, every browser has a built in JS interpreter that allows you to run JS code on the client side. One thing to note, however, is that the JavaScript interpreter runs your code in **two steps: 1) it parses through your code and rearranges it to make it easier to run line by line and then 2) it actually runs it line by line!**Understanding these two steps is the key to understanding some of the "weird quirks" of JavaScript.

## JavaScript uses an event-driven programming style

Think about a scenario where you are expecting a package to be delivered to your door sometime over the next 3 days but you are going to be out of town. You tell your roommate to sign for the package on your behalf when it arrives. Imagine that your roommate **stands in front of the door for 2 days waiting until the package arrives and then signs for the package after it arrives. That's such a waste of time!** If instead, your roommate **listened** for the package to arrive while going about his/her other chores, your roommate **takes care of many other tasks and then just keeps track of what to do (_list of_ _instructions_) once the package arrives (_event_).** **So much more efficient!**

**Note: Pay special attention to the following keywords (talked about above) while you're going through the rest of the JavaScript module**: _Listener, List of instructions, Event_

JavaScript is extremely fun to work with especially on the front-end and there is a lot to explore with it -- we recommend that you first focus on what we will teach you in the next few chapters and then explore some of the more advanced concepts after.

## Goals for the Javascript Module

This module is designed to get you familiar with the basics of JavaScript, Algorithms, and DOM manipulation. With these skills in your back pocket, nothing can stop you. There is a lot of great information that you may want to review at various times throughout the course so feel free to come back as much as you can.
