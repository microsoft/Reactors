# JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks

The web today is a dynamic place that we have learned heavily relies on JavaScript to make things happen in our webpages. So how do all the web developers make fancy carousels, slideshows, and all that great functionality that we are used to on the internet?

## JavaScript libraries make adding functionality to our websites easier

Ever wonder how developers create such great tools to display images and slideshows?
It is possible that when we view two different slideshows on two different websites that the developers who maintain those websites are writing unique code. Most likely they re-used code that some other programmer wrote and saved in a file that they shared online.

In JavaScript, the way we share code we've written in the past is by using a library. A library is a JavaScript file that contains a bunch of functions, and those functions accomplish some useful tasks for your websites.

How do we know what's in a specific library? Is there an index? We could look at the JavaScript file, if it's short, or better, we could look at the documentation. Most libraries have documentation with a list of available functions or a real-world examples.

When a developer creates a JS library and puts it out into the world, they're purposefully deciding to share it with others - so that often means they put in the effort to come up with great documentation and examples. Perhaps one day you will decide to create a library of some functionality that you find really useful and contribute to the internet.

There are always new JS libraries being created, so you should always do some research before you start writing code.

Here are some of the most popular JS Libraries and Frameworks that are being used (Jan. 2020) today:

* NodeJS - Node.js or Node JS is another powerful JavaScript framework which allows you to develop a server-side component using JavaScript.
* ReactJS - React is Facebook’s component-based web development framework for making UIs and offering declarative views, which makes the code more predictable and easier to debug.
* VueJS - Vue.js is another open-source progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, similar to React.
* jQuery - jQuery is probably the most popular JavaScript library out there which provides so many features for modern-day development.
* Angular - Angular previously known as Angular JS is a single web development framework developed by Google for both desktop and mobile web applications.

You can use jQuery API for event handling, animation and manipulating of the HTML document, also known as DOM. Besides this, jQuery is being used in some of the other web building tools like React and Angular. In short, it is one of the must-know JavaScript libraries for web development. We'll be using jQuery some more in the next section as we build out our Capstone Project.
